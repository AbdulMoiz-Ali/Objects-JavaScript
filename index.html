        If you wanted to use this data in JavaScript, you could assign each value to a different <br>
variable, like this. <br>
1 var plan1Name = "Basic"; <br>
2 var plan1Price = 3.99; <br>
3 var plan1Space = 100; <br>
4 var plan1Data = 1000; <br>
5 var plan1Pages = 10; <br>
6 var plan2Name = "Professional"; <br>
7 var plan2Price = 5.99; <br>
8 var plan2Space = 500; <br>
9 var plan2Data = 5000; <br>
10 var plan2Pages = 50; <br>
11 var plan3Name = "Ultimate"; <br>
12 var plan3Price = 9.99; <br>
13 var plan3Space = 2000; <br>
14 var plan3Data = 20000; <br>
15 var plan3Pages = 500; <br>
Having made all these variable assignments, you could then, for example, write this <br>
JavaScript statement... <br>
alert("The cost of the " + plan2Name + "package is $" + plan2Price + " per month."); <br>
...and an alert would display saying, "The cost of the Professional package is $5.99 per <br>
month." <br>
But assigning all these values to variables is unwieldy, and can lead to problems if things <br>
get complicated. A better way to handle the situation is to create objects with properties. This <br>
is a handier scheme that more accurately reflects the 2-dimensional, gridlike nature of the host <br>
company's table that we started with. This table shows all the options expressed as objects and <br>
properties.

        In this example, each hosting plan is an object—plan1, plan2, plan3. And each object has <br>
5 properties—name, cost, space, transfer, and pages. Properties are just variables that are <br>
attached to an object. In this case, there's a string property (name) and four number properties <br>
(price, space, transfer, and pages) for each object. <br>
In code we refer to objects and their properties using dot notation. Here's the statement <br>
that creates the alert shown above, with object-property pairs replacing the simple variables. <br>
alert("The cost of the " + plan2.name + " package is $" + plan2.price + " per month."); <br>
plan2.name represents "Professional". plan2.price represents 5.99. <br>
The most straightforward way to define an object and its properties is this. <br>
1 var plan1 = { <br>
2 name: "Basic", <br>
3 price: 3.99, <br>
4 space: 100, <br>
5 transfer: 1000, <br>
6 pages: 10 <br>
7 }; <br>
Things to notice: <br>
The code begins like any variable definition, with the keyword var, followed by the <br>
object name, and then an equal sign. <br>
But then, instead of a value, there's a curly bracket, whose twin comes at the end of the <br>
block. <br>
220 <br>
Each property begins with a name, followed by a colon, and then a value. <br>
Each property definition except the last ends with a comma. <br>
The closing curly bracket is followed by a semicolon, because of the equal sign in the <br>
first line. <br>
Now let's add one more property, discountMonths. If the current month is July, August, <br>
or December, the customer gets a 20 percent discount on the hosting plan. To keep track of <br>
those special months, we'll assign them to a new property. This new property is an array, not a <br>
simple variable. <br>
plan1.discountMonths = [6, 7, 11]; <br>
The statement above creates a new property of the object plan1, discountMonths, and <br>
assigns an array to it representing the three months when the customer gets a discount. <br>
You refer to the individual elements of this array property the same way you'd refer to the <br>
elements of any array, with a number inside brackets, but using the dot notation of the objectproperty pair, plan1.discountMonths. <br>
var mo = plan1.discountMonths[2]; <br>
The statement above assigns the third element of the array, the number representing <br>
December, to the variable mo. <br>
So far, we've defined only one object, plan1, and its properties. To complete the set of <br>
objects that includes plan2 and plan3, you'd have to do the same thing again, and then again. <br>
You may be thinking that this all takes more work than just defining 15 simple variables as I <br>
did early in the chapter, but defining objects and their properties is actually a better way to go,  <br>
for reasons that I'll discuss in later chapters. Plus, there's a less labor-intensive way to go <br>
about it, which you'll also learn.

      <p class="ali">
        To change the value of an object's number value, use a simple assignment statement, the <br>
same way you'd assign a value to a plain variable. <br>
deal3.cost = 79.95; <br>
Whatever the value of deal3.cost was, now it's 79.95. <br>
Of course, you can assign a string instead of a number. <br>
deal3.name = "Super-saver"; <br>
Whatever the value of deal3.name was, now it's "Super-saver". <br>
You can also assign an array list to a property. <br>
deal3.features = ["Guarantee", "Free Ship"]; <br>
Whatever the value of deal3.features was, now it's an array with the elements <br>
"Guarantee" and "Free Ship." <br>
You can also assign a Boolean value. <br>
deal3.membersOnly = false; <br>
Whatever the value of deal3.membersOnly was, now it's false. <br>
You can also use an assignment statement to define a new property for an object. Suppose <br>
the object deal3 has some properties, but none of them are deal3.market. Now you want to <br>
add it, while assigning it a value. <br>
deal3.market = "regional"; <br>
Just as you can create an undefined variable by not assigning it a value, you can create an <br>
object without any properties. <br>
var deal4 = {}; <br>
If you want to create a property now and assign it a value later, you can create it with a <br>
value of undefined. <br>
deal3.market = undefined; <br>
Note that the keyword undefined isn't in quotation marks. It isn't a string. <br>
You can delete a property of an object. <br>
delete deal3.market; <br>
You can check to see if a property of an object exists. The following statement tests <br>
whether there is such a thing as deal3.market and assigns the result (true or false) to the <br>
variable propertyExists. <br>
propertyExists = "market" in deal3; <br>
Things to notice: <br>
You could use any legal variable name instead of propertyExists. <br>
The keyword in asks, "The property market is in the object deal3—true or false?" <br>
The property market is in quotes. <br>
The object deal3 is not in quotes.

      <p class="ali">
        We're going to write a function that calculates the annual charge based on this chart. Note  <br>
that if the user signs up at certain times of the year, he gets a discount for the entire year. If he <br>
signs up for the Basic plan in July or August, he gets 20 per cent off. If he signs up for the <br>
Professional plan in July, August, or December, he gets 20 per cent off. If he signs up for the <br>
Ultimate plan in July or August, he gets 20 per cent off. <br>
We begin by creating three objects with properties. This is the object and its properties <br>
that represent the Basic plan. <br>
1 var plan1 = { <br>
2 name: "Basic", <br>
3 price: 3.99, <br>
4 space: 100, <br>
5 transfer: 1000, <br>
6 pages: 10, <br>
7 discountMonths: [6, 7] <br>
8 }; <br>
The function cycles through all the discount months (line 5) checking to see if any of them <br>
happen to be the current month (line 6). If so, it calculates a 20 percent discount by multiplying <br>
the regular price by .8. Then it multiplies the monthly price, discounted or not, by 12, to get the <br>
annual price, and returns the number to the calling code (line 11). <br>
1 function calcAnnual() { <br>
2 var bestPrice = plan1.price; <br>
3 var currDate = new Date(); <br>
4 var thisMo = currDate.getMonth(); <br>
5 for (var i = 0; i < plan1.discountMonths.length; i++) { <br>
6 if (plan1.discountMonths[i] === thisMo) { <br>
7 bestPrice = plan1.price * .8; <br>
8 break; <br>
9 } <br>
10 } <br>
11 return bestPrice * 12; <br>
12 } <br>
This is the calling statement that executes the function. <br>
var annualPrice = calcAnnual(); <br>
But now let's make the function more flexible so the discount rate can vary, depending on <br>
the value that the calling statement passes to it. Here's the revision, with the percentage to be <br>
charged, passed to the parameter percentIfDisc, if the user qualifies for a discount. <br>
1 function calcAnnual(percentIfDisc) { <br>
2 var bestPrice = plan1.price; <br>
3 var currDate = new Date(); <br>
4 var thisMo = currDate.getMonth(); <br>
5 for (var i = 0; i < plan1.discountMonths.length; i++) { <br>
6 if (plan1.discountMonths[i] === thisMo) { <br>
7 bestPrice = plan1.price * percentIfDisc; <br>
8 break; <br>
9 } <br>
10 } <br>
11 return bestPrice * 12; <br>
12 } <br>
This is the calling statement that passes the value to the function and executes it. In this <br>
example, it passes the value .85, representing a discount of 15 percent. <br>
var annual Price = calcAnnual(.85); <br>
You've learned that you can attach a variable to an object, and the variable becomes the <br>
object's property. Here's more news. You can attach a function to an object, and the function <br>
becomes that object's method. It does the same task the regular function does, but now it's <br>
attached to an object. The reasons why you would want to use a method rather than an ordinary <br>
function will become clear in subsequent chapters. For now, let me show you how it's done. <br>
This code inserts the function that I coded above into the object definition, so now it's a <br>
method. Operationally, it's the same as the plain-vanilla function, but now it's attached to the <br>
object. <br>
1 var plan1 = { <br>
2 name: "Basic", <br>
3 price: 3.99, <br>
4 space: 100, <br>
5 transfer: 1000, <br>
6 pages: 10, <br>
7 discountMonths: [6, 7], <br>
8 calcAnnual: function(percentIfDisc) { <br>
9 var bestPrice = plan1.price; <br>
10 var currDate = new Date(); <br>
11 var thisMo = currDate.getMonth(); <br>
12 for (var i = 0; i < plan1.discountMonths.length; i++) { <br>
13 if (plan1.discountMonths[i] === thisMo) { <br>
14 bestPrice = plan1.price * percentIfDisc; <br>
15 break; <br>
16 } <br>
17 } <br>
18 return bestPrice * 12; <br>
19 } <br>
20 }; <br>
Things to notice: <br>
Except for the first line, every line of the method is identical to the code I used to create <br>
the plain-vanilla function that we started with. <br>
The method definition begins the same way a property definition begins, with the name <br>
followed by a colon. <br>
A comma ends every property definition and method definition except for the last <br>
property or method. If you were to add a property or method below the calcAnnual <br>
method definition, you'd need to insert a comma after the closing curly bracket of the <br>
calcAnnual definition. <br>
The parentheses that indicate that a variable name is the name of a function come <br>
immediately after the keyword function. Parameters, if there are any, go inside the <br>
parens, as in any function definition. <br>
This is how you'd call the method. <br>
var annualPrice = plan1.calcAnnual(.85); <br>
I'm going to add a refinement to the method definition. In the definition I coded above, the <br>
properties are referred to using the name of the object—for example, plan1.price. This <br>
works, but a better approach, for reasons that will become clear in subsequent chapters, is to <br>
replace the name of the object with the keyword this. When JavaScript sees this keyword, it <br>
knows you're referring to the object that's being defined. <br>
1 var plan1 = { <br>
2 name: "Basic", <br>
3 price: 3.99, <br>
4 space: 100, <br>
5 transfer: 1000, <br>
6 pages: 10, <br>
7 discountMonths: [6, 7], <br>
8 calcAnnual: function(percentIfDisc) { <br>
9 var bestPrice = this.price; <br>
10 var currDate = new Date(); <br>
11 var thisMo = currDate.getMonth(); <br>
12 for (var i = 0; i < this.discountMonths.length; i++) { <br>
13 if (this.discountMonths[i] === thisMo) { <br>
14 bestPrice = this.price * percentIfDisc; <br>
15 break; <br>
16 } <br>
17 } <br>
18 return bestPrice * 12; <br>
19 } <br>
20 }; <br>
When you write this.whatever, JavaScript is smart enough to understand that you're <br>
referring to a property of the object that's being defined—in this case, plan1.

5 transfer: 1000, <br>
6 pages: 10 <br>
7 }; <br>
But that only gets us an object that represents the first plan. I'd have to do the same thing  <br>
again for the Professional and Ultimate plans. This is too much hand craftsmanship. We need a <br>
factory to crank out these things by the dozen. JavaScript lets you build such a factory. It's <br>
called a constructor function. <br>
1 function Plan(name, price, space, transfer, pages) { <br>
2 this.name = name; <br>
3 this.price = price; <br>
4 this.space = space; <br>
5 this.transfer = transfer; <br>
6 this.pages = pages; <br>
7 } <br>
This would be a plain-vanilla function definition but for two differences: <br>
The function name is capitalized. JavaScript doesn't care whether you do this or not, but <br>
it's conventional to do it to distinguish constructor functions from regular functions. <br>
Each of the parameter values is assigned to a variable. But the variable is a property <br>
attached to some object whose name hasn't been specified yet. But don't worry. Just as the <br>
parameter values will be filled in by the calling code, so will the name of the object. <br>
This is the calling code that creates the object for the Basic plan. <br>
var plan1 = new Plan("Basic", 3.99, 100, 1000, 10); <br>
This would be just a regular function call if it weren't for that new. It's the keyword that <br>
tells JavaScript to create a new object. The name of the new object is plan1. Its properties are <br>
enumerated inside the parentheses. <br>
Now it's easy to mass-produce as many objects as you want, using the same pattern. <br>
1 var plan1 = new Plan("Basic", 3.99, 100, 1000, 10); <br>
2 var plan2 = new Plan("Premium", 5.99, 500, 5000, 50); <br>
3 var plan3 = new Plan("Ultimate", 9.99, 2000, 20000, 500); <br>
It's common to use the same names for parameters and properties, but you don't have to. <br>
You could write: <br>
1 function Plan(name, price, space, transfer, pages) { <br>
2 this.doc = name; <br>
3 this.grumpy = price; <br>
4 this.sleepy = space; <br>
5 this.bashful = transfer; <br>
6 this.sneezy = pages; <br>
7 }

        In Chapter 71 I showed you how to attach a function to an object, using the same approach  <br>
you use when you attach a variable to an object. When you attach a variable to an object, it's <br>
called a property of the object. When you attach a function to an object, it's called a method of <br>
the object. In the example below, the method checks to see if the current date is in a discount <br>
month and, if so, applies the discount. Then the method calculates the annual charge. <br>
If you're creating more than one object with the same pattern of properties and methods, <br>
it's a convenience to build the method as well as the properties into the constructor function. <br>
In the following code, the constructor creates the same method for every object that is <br>
created, as it creates all the properties for each object. <br>
1 function Plan(name, price, space, transfer, pages, discountMonths) { <br>
2 this.name = name; <br>
3 this.price = price; <br>
4 this.space = space; <br>
5 this.transfer = transfer; <br>
6 this.pages = pages; <br>
7 this.discountMonths = discountMonths; <br>
8 this.calcAnnual = function(percentIfDisc) { <br>
9 var bestPrice = this.price; <br>
10 var currDate = new Date(); <br>
11 var thisMo = currDate.getMonth(); <br>
12 for (var i = 0; i < this.discountMonths.length; i++) { <br>
13 if (this.discountMonths[i] === thisMo) { <br>
14 bestPrice = this.price * percentIfDisc; <br>
15 break; <br>
16 } <br>
17 } <br>
18 return bestPrice * 12; <br>
19 }; <br>
20 } <br>
Things to notice about line 8, the beginning of the method definition: <br>
Like the property definitions above it, the line begins with the keyword this, referring to <br>
the name of whatever object is being constructed at any given time. <br>
The next three pieces are the same: a dot, the name of the method, and an equal sign. <br>
The next piece is different: the keyword function. <br>
In this case, a single parameter is inside the parentheses, percentIfDisc. This is not a <br>
parameter that's part of the constructor. It's a parameter of the method that the constructor <br>
will create for each object. A value is passed to it not when a new object is created using <br>
the constructor, but when the method, having already been created along with its object <br>
via the constructor, is called. <br>
This is the code that calls the constructor function to create three new objects that <br>
correspond to the three hosting plans. <br>
1 var p1 = new Plan("Basic", 3.99, 100, 1000, 10, [6, 7]); <br>
2 var p2 = new Plan("Premium", 5.99, 500, 5000, 50, [6, 7, 11]); <br>
3 var p3 = new Plan("Ultimate", 9.99, 2000, 20000, 500, [6, 7]); <br>
Once the objects and their properties and method are created by the code above, this is <br>
the code that calls, for example, the method for the Premium plan. <br>
var annualPrice = p2.calAnnual(.85); <br>
The main difference between the method definition in the one-off literal object definition <br>
(no constructor) and the method definition in the constructor function is the first line. In other <br>
respects, both definitions are identical. <br>
This is the first line of a method definition when an object is created on a one-off basis <br>
without a constructor: <br>
calcAnnual: function(percentIfDisc) { <br>
This is the first line of a method definition within a constructor: <br>
this.calcAnnual = function(percentIfDisc) { <br>
There are two other differences. Because in the constructor function the method definition <br>
begins with an assignment (something = something else), you need a semicolon after the <br>
closing curly bracket. And no comma is necessary if another property or method definition <br>
follows.

        There's something inelegant about the green last row. The properties shown in the rows <br>
above it are customized for each object, but the method is always the same from object to <br>
object. The constructor function keeps duplicating the same method for each object, object <br>
after object. If we were to create 100 objects using the constructor, JavaScript would <br>
duplicate the same method 100 times, once for each object. It would work, but it ain't pretty. <br>

        We want only one copy of the method, shared by all objects created with the constructor, <br>
no matter how many objects are created. <br>
How do we do it? With a prototype statement. <br>
First, we don't include the method in the constructor function, because that creates a copy <br>
of the method for every single object that's created with the constructor. <br>
Instead, we define the method as a prototype of the constructor, this way. <br>
1 Plan.prototype.calcAnnual = function(percentIfDisc) { <br>
2 var bestPrice = this.price; <br>
3 var currDate = new Date(); <br>
4 var thisMo = currDate.getMonth(); <br>
5 for (var i = 0; i < this.discountMonths.length; i++) { <br>
6 if (this.discountMonths[i] === thisMo) { <br>
7 bestPrice = this.price * percentIfDisc; <br>
8 break; <br>
9 } <br>
10 } <br>
11 return bestPrice * 12; <br>
12 }; <br>
Now, all objects created with the constructor Plan will share the same copy of the <br>
method calcAnnual. There's no unnecessary duplication. <br>
Note that except for the first line, the method is coded exactly as I coded it when it was <br>
part of the constructor definition. Even the first line is the same, if you consider only the parts <br>
on the right side of the equal sign. The parts on the left side, connected by dots, are: <br>
the name of the constructor function, in this case Plan <br>
the keyword prototype <br>
the name of the method that all objects created with Plan will share, in this case <br>
calcAnnual <br>
Objects can have prototype properties as well as prototype methods. Suppose you wanted <br>
all objects created with the Plan to share the same property, cancellable, with a value of <br>
true. You'd code the prototype this way. <br>
Plan.prototype.cancellable = true; <br>
Now all objects created with the constructor function Plan share a property, <br>
cancellable, whose value is true. <br>
This is how the object table looks with the prototype method and the prototype property. <br>

      <h1>-: OObjects:Checking for properties and methods :-</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        You can check to see if an object has a particular property by writing a simple statement <br>
like this. <br>
var gotTheProperty = "price" in plan1; <br>
Here are the parts: <br>
the property in question, enclosed in quotes—in this case, price <br>
the keyword in <br>
the object, in this case, plan1 <br>
Again, the question is, does the object named plan1 have a property called price? In <br>
other words, is there such a thing as plan1.price? In the example of three hosting plans that <br>
we've been using, plan1 does have a price, 3.99. So gotTheProperty is assigned true. But <br>
plan1 doesn't have a property named location. So if we write... <br>
var gotTheProperty = "location" in plan1; <br>
...the variable gotTheProperty is false. <br>
plan1 in the example also has a method named calcAnnual. A method is a type of <br>
property of an object, so if you write... <br>
var gotTheProperty = "calcAnnual" in plan1; <br>
...the variable gotTheProperty is true. <br>
Things to notice: <br>
The property, a variable, is enclosed in quotation marks. We're not used to putting <br>
JavaScript variables inside quotation marks, so this is something to make a note of. <br>
The keyword is in—pretty intuitive. The code asks, "Is there a property called 'price' in <br>
plan1?" <br>
If you want a list of an object's properties, there's a spiffy way to do it: <br>
1 var listOfProperties = []; <br>
2 for (var prop in plan1) { <br>
3 listOfProperties.push(prop); <br>
4 } <br>
Line 1 declares an empty array, listOfProperties. Lines 2-4 cycle through all the <br>
properties of plan1, adding each property (push), including any methods, to the array <br>
listOfProperties. Using the example we've been working with, the array <br>
listOfProperties winds up with a value of <br>
"name,price,space,transfer,pages,discountMonths,calcAnnual". <br>
Note that, unlike a regular for loop, this one doesn't establish a limit on the number of <br>
loops or increment a counter. After each iteration, JavaScript automatically moves to the next <br>
property of the object and stops iterating when there are no more properties to enumerate. <br>
Note also that instead of prop, you could use any other legal variable name. <br>
In the example, the method, calcAnnual, wasn't included in the original definition of the <br>
object plan1. It was later added to the prototype of the constructor function that I used to <br>
create the object, and so became a property of the object by inheritance. The code above <br>
includes inherited properties (including methods) in the collection. If you want to limit the lis <br>t
of properties to those that have been explicitly declared for the object, omitting those that are <br>
inherited from a prototype, you need to use hasOwnProperty. <br>
1 var listOfProperties = []; <br>
2 for (var prop in plan1) { <br>
3 if (plan1.hasOwnProperty(prop)) { <br>
4 listOfProperties.push(prop); <br>
5 } <br>
6 } <br>
In the example above, each property in turn is assigned to the variable prop. Then the if <br>
statement tests to see if it's a property owned by the object as opposed to being inherited <br>
through a prototype. <br>
You can of course test a literal property name instead of using a variable. <br>
var isOwnedProperty = plan1.hasOwnProperty("price"); <br>
